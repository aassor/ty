        rgate F.C. is an English football team based in the seaside resort of Margate, Kent. They currently play in the Isthmian League Premier Division. The club was founded in 1896 and joined the Southern Football League in 1933. After a spell in the Kent League after World War II, the team returned to the Southern League in 1959 and remained there until 2001 when they gained promotion to the Football Conference, the highest level of English non-League football. Their stay at this level saw the team forced to groundshare with other clubs due to drawn-out and problematic redevelopment work at their Hartsdown Park stadium, and they were expelled from the Conference National and subsequently relegated to the Isthmian League. The team, known for a number of years during the 1980s as Thanet United, and nicknamed "The Gate", have twice reached the third round proper of the FA Cup. On the second occasion, they played Tottenham Hotspur, the reigning UEFA Cup
